			<div><p>Predictive modeling refers to use statistics to predict outcomes.The holder usually wants to predict the trend or situation in the future, it, however, can be applied to any type of unknown event<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" style="color:skyblue;">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.

				<b>This model</b> is used to predict the customer churn in retirement segment and identify the indicators of churn rate through  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" class="mw-redirect" title="Big Data" style="color:skyblue;">Big Data</a> analysis involving a data mining approach named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" class="mw-redirect" title="Decision Tree" style="color:skyblue;">Decision Tree</a> such as Classification and Regression Tree (CRT)<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" style="color:skyblue;">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>.</p>

				<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abstract"><b>Abstract</b></span></h2>
				<p>Recently, resulting from the developing technology as well as the availability of various products and services, the changing options and expectations of customers have generated a highly competitive situation in a number of areas such as the financial, fitness and telecom industry, including the threats and competition from direct competitors and new entrants. Therefore, customer relationship management (CRM) systems have become an escalating powerful medium to address these difficulties<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" style="color:skyblue;">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>.

				</p>
				<p class="mw-empty-elt"></p><p>The principal objective is to create a model to predict churn and discover the impact of individual behaviours from different aspects through big data analysis, which includes the integration of archival and unstructured data from websites, page views and phone records. It applied both the Datameer tool and the SAS business intelligence system to achieve the goal with more than 3 million information in the retiree section of the Canadian bank between 2011 and 2015.
				</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></span></h2>
				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Background"><b>Background</b></span></h3>
				<p>In the contemporary society, because of the threats and disruption from competitors, the majority of incorporation consider the client retention rate as the most primary priority to maintain competitive advantages. As a famous area in machine learning, customer churn prediction, however, is one of the fundamentals of CRM who sponsors new research to evaluate a variety of marketing solutions to maximize the retention rate <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" style="color:skyblue;">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>. Additionally, the churn rate refers to the annual per cent of terminating the business relationship or ceasing the service.
				</p>
				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Methodology"><b>Methodology</b></span></h3>
				<p>Through the techniques of big data analysis in terms of decision tree and regression analysis, this research constructs a churn model for prediction fundamental on a dataset containing mass-affluent customers from retirement whose accuracy is beneficial to precise of retention activities in the future churners for companies <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" style="color:skyblue;">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>. Besides, there are four different categories of clients in the model: churned, not churned, moderately churned and maintained customers, which assist to make a corresponding strategy to sustain customers.
				</p>

				</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The model"><b>The model</b></span></h2>
				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Data collection"><b>Data collection</b></span></h3>
				<p>The data derives from the integration of archival demographic data, and information gathered from various websites as well as external products that users have visited in the duration of this research. Moreover, churn signals are conducted by evaluating behavioural clues through big data analysis, which are clustered from the bank website, including frequently asked questions, emails, search engines, blogs, as well as contractual data, call centre and the interacting record of financial notes with customers.
				</p>
				<p class="mw-empty-elt"></p><p>In this research, the target population composes of both mass and non-mass affluent customers who are not retired and possess more than one active products with the age ranging from  50 to 71 years old. It involves more than 3 million population ( 3,144,132 individuals) between  2011 and 2015 to guarantee the sufficiency of observation during the period of the study.

				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deployment"><b>Deployment</b></span></h3>
				<p>The implementation of Datameer software, combined with SA business intelligence platform, enables this study to reveal massive data and information, which are relevant to around 3 million records of customers between 2011 and 2015. Hence a wealth of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data can be processed in Datameer on the SAS platform.
				</p>
				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pattern recognition cues"><b>Pattern recognition cues</b></span></h3>
				<p>A number of cues were analyzed to identify the most associated ones with retirement and possible churn events. They can be divided into four categories, including lifestyle, feedback, information discovery and behaviour. The population was categorized into two groups of the retired and non-retired after the application of these cues, and then they are further separated into two subsets of retained and attrited.
				</p>
				<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Consolidation of model"><b>Consolidation of model</b></span></h3>
				<p>To overcome the major difficulty of targeting the right clients, it is necessary to implement a consolidation model, which can effectively differentiate loyal users from the actual churners and enhance the accuracy of data analysis.
				</p>
				<p>In MI (Money In) balance, prior to retirement and post-retirement for 6 months (-6 months and +6 months, respectively) is regarded to estimate if the consolidation of assets occurred with the target bank or other institutes. The definition of the criteria is the first step, in terms of the minimum and maximum balance as well as the growth rate. In this experiment, the clients who have less than $4000 over 6 months are considered as inactive users, which means they are already attrited. Nonetheless, those clients who hold over $10,000,000 in their balance among the period remain loyal. Therefore, this research only included all the clients whose MI balances is between $4 M and $10 M.
				</p>
				<p>The strategy of categorization can be concluded as three principles. First and foremost, the consolidation with the target bank can be defined as the MI balance climbing by over 10%. Nevertheless, when the MI balance drops by more than 10%, it refers to the consolidation with OFI. Eventually, the loyalty of retirees can be determined by the MI balance either increasing or decreasing by under 10%.

				<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Findings"><b>Findings</b></span></h2>
				</p><p>1) Both the <b><i>length</i></b> and <b><i>strength</i></b> with the banking correlation are indicative of options to churn. According to the data analysis, after retirements between two years to three years, the rate of attrition reaches the zenith. Reversely, Since those who own longer occupation and tight relationships with the bank are more impossible to churn, the consolidation of the correlation will decrease the proportion of attrition.

				</p><p>2) Contrast to mass affluent clients, <b><i>non-mass affluent</i></b> customers agitate at a more rapid rate.  More specifically, the mass-affluent customers are over two times to retire in the target bank but under two times to churn from it. Compared with mass retail, despite the lower rate of attrition, mass-affluent accounts for such a large proportion (a multi-billion dollar market) that affects considerably the profitability of the bank.
				</p><p>3) Based on the data analysis, <b><i>neither the online purchase nor the page view</i></b> has considerable impacts on the rate of churn. Additionally, due to the slight gap of the attrition rate between online customers and non-online clients, it can not be concluded that the behaviours on the internet result in a lower rate.
				</p><p>4) Compared with traditional churn prediction models, it improved the outcome by <b><i>175%</i></b> through the combination of CRT and linear regression analysis.
				<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusions"><b>Conclusions</b></span></h2>
				<p>1) This research constructed an effective customer churn model through big data analysis, which will cause more accurate prediction and identification of potential churners and then result in more successful strategies to maximize the retention.

				</p><p>2) It effectively identify the contributing factors of the churn rate, as well. The occupation, longer duration and consolidation of interaction with the target bank decrease the rate of attrition, while the majority of churn commences from two to three years after retirement.
				</p><p>3) Another achievement of this paper is that it also excludes a number of indications having no effects on the attrition, including purchase online and the frequency of page view.
				</p><p>4) The incorporation of data source, the approach of data analysis and the ulitization of the analytic tool, Datameer, generates a considerable promotion of the outcome in the churn model, which is the final contribution.
				</p><p>5) There are several limitations in the study, too. Since the Internet and social media usage is increasingly updated, the results of this research will vary from the outcomes in the future when the younger generation reaches their retirement stage. In the future directions, the appropriate receptive point, which means the clients are more acceptable for retirement suggestion, should be focused.
